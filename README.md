# Top-250-Series---IMDB-web-scraping
Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup One of multiple web scraping benefits is that you can get anything you want from The Internet, for this project I wanted to watch a tv series but I couldn't choose one so I scrapped the internet movie database to know which series should I start with, saving the result into a CSV file which contains [index, series name, year of production, rate] that made it easy to choose what should I watch first. 
## HAVE A NICE WATCH!
