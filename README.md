# Top-250-Series---IMDB-web-scraping
Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup
One of multiple web scraping benifits that you can get anything you want from The Internet, for this project i wanted to watch a tv series but i couldnt choose one so i scrapped the internet movie data base to know which series should i start with, saving the result into a csv file which contains [index, series name, year of production, rate] that made it easy to choose what should i watch first.
## HAVE A NICE WATCH !!
